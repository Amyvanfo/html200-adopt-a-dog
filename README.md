Adopt a Dog
===========
This is a course project that I made for the course HTML200. A design mockup and photo assets were provided by instructor. All coding is written by me.

What is it?
----------
The site uses a combination of web development languages HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery to display different content and interactions. It is this first time I have used Media Queries, Javascript and Jquery on a web site.

Client User profile 1
------------
User persona 1: Clare.  

Personal: Clare Jones is about 35 years old. She is the married mother of two young children.  
Highest level of education: professional degree. She and her spouse are both college graduates. Lifestyle/job description: Young family. Busy work life, both parents work full time. They live in a rural or suburban setting.  
Why will they come to the site? Claire is an experienced pet owner but currently doesn’t have a pet and knows she wants one. She wants to use the site to do some advance research about types of dogs suitable for her family.  
How will they come to the site? The user knows she wants a pet, so the type of product she wants from our site is clear. To find out site, she could do a search engine search on “pet adoption in my area” which would bring up our site as a result for the Seattle area. We may also be able to be linked as a sister resource from other sites like PAWS, Humane Society. She might also visit the site via a social media post or ad.  
Technical: My user is technically proficient. Because she is at a desk using a PC most of the day, she would probably use her desktop PC to visit our site because that’s the tool she is on for the most hours of the day. She uses an Android smartphone frequently and fluently to access many apps, social media services, text, and email, so she might use this to visit the site as well. I don’t think she spends a lot of time browsing the web each day-- maybe an hour or less of time just roaming the internet.  
Motivation for visiting: To save time: If she is interested in a service, she will have a  clear idea of what she needs to know and will want to focus on getting the information she needs to save her time driving around or doing research in a lot of other places.

testing 2-1-2020
All pages - header photo, gradient does not display on small screens./Fix: small screen added smaller photo for image. Medium, fixed logo size which fixed picture. Gradient still needs to be fixed.   
header - adopt a dog  logo is cut off at left on small, medium screens./fix: moved it over & made smaller.  
header- white space at left and top of small screens, but not at left/ fix: eliminated margins in body.
on index page -  cards sometimes not centered on small and medium screens in Chrome devtools, sometimes looks okay./ margin change in above answer helps this issue. Changed margins for section.  
Blog page- large screen. text does not display in line at right of photo./  fix: swapped out the javascript version for older version with formatting.
Index and Dogs page. Dog card content runs over the footer on small and medium screen size./ FIX: hide the footer element on small screens-- not an "important" element.  
all pages some links in footer do not work/FIX: fixed all links to point to active pages.  
medium screen - very narrow dog cards on blog and index/ fix: n/a. I think the readability is acceptable for now. Will save ths for v 2.0.
