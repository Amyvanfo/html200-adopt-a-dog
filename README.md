Adopt a Dog
===========
This is a course project that I made for the course HTML200. A design mockup and photo assets were provided, all coding is written by me.

What is it?
----------
The site uses a combination of web development languages HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery to display different content and interactions.   
It is this first time I have used Media Queries, Javascript and Jquery on a web site.
