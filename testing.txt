Testing notes:
**Viewed each page on Windows/Chrome/iPhone/android phone,
**for text, controls and image align:
index full size-ok
dogs - ok all sizes:
blog - full size - issue Adopt a dog logo not showing on this page. issue: text needs to go beside each image. small screen: images cut off./fix: reverted to previous version of page w/o javascript.
Checkout - Full-size issue: most looks ok. there is a lot of white space at right. small screen: submit button is cut off./doesn't affect function. Fix later.
All pages: small screens: issue: top dog image not showing./fix: for medium screen, making the logo smaller fixed this. For small screen, cropped a smaller photo for this space.
Bottom footer is being covered up by cards./fix: do not display footer and gray button at small sizes.
**Hover for each page.
index - full size- blue hover effect works. Adopt button is adequate size and action works. small screen: ok
dogs - full size - looks good. On medium screen, cards and text are too small./Fix: ok for now.
checkout - full size - submit button works. issue: get rid of checkout button on this page as it links to current page./ Fix: n/aokay for now.
**Suitable clickable area.
 All buttons and links large enough on large. Small screen ok. Medium screen dog cards get very small with small text./fix n/a okay for now.
**Color, Shading Gradient:
all pages: background gradient seems to work when disabling the img link style.
Colors- button, footer, backgrounds, nav colors ok.
**correct padding-
Nav words (sometimes) run off the right side at medium screen./fis:  retested. Seems to look ok.
index and dogs page sometimes display off center at small sizes./FIX: added class and margin-right to this section.
there is a white margin around header left and top at small and medium sizes./Fix: set body margin to 0 and this seemed to fix it.
**text images controls and frames do not run into the edges of the screen.
- on small screens, adoptadog header logo runs over edge for all pages./ fix: made smaller, moved it to the left.
